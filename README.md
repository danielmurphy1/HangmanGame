### Summary

This is my second console app using C#. It has been a while since I have written any C#, but what I did learn before came back quickly. That application is not overly complicated, but I did learn some things in creating this application. Firstly, I learned that arrays in C# are not easily manipulated dynamically in some other languages (such as JavaScript or TypeScript). Rather, when dealing with a set of data that will add or shrink based on the flow of the application, it is much better (and preferred as far as I can tell from my research), to use a List<>. So, I learned a bit about Lists and implemented a few in my application for data sets that changed dynamically as the application runs. Additionally, I learned that it is much easier to use the debugging tools in Visual Studio rather than to rely on using Console.Write to display current values of fields/properties/variables. I would say that I certainly learned a bit more about Visual Studio in creating this application. 

The game is fun to play, and it mimics what we used to do so many years ago on the chalkboard/whiteboard in grade school. I am glad that I made it, and I look forward to learning more about C# and .NET as a create more complicated projects/applications in the future.
